Homework 6: Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Goal
This Weather Dashboard is meant to take a city name as an input, then return current day weather, 5 day forecast, and also save searches as selectable buttons for later recall. At present, current weather and 5 day forecast work, albeit inelegantly. 

## Known issues
1. Buttons for past searches are not being created.
2. Icons are not present in the weather, or 5 day forecast results.
3. Styling needs tweaking all around
4. Could optimize code by rewriting as a for loop if I had time, but prioritizing group project at this stage.
