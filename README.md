Homework 6: Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Goal
This Weather Dashboard is meant to take a city name as an input, then return current day weather, 5 day forecast, and also save searches as selectable buttons for later recall. 

## Status
At present, current weather and 5 day forecast work, albeit inelegantly. All of the pieces are where they need to be, but I have further functionality to code in and stylistic grooming aplenty remaining. However, given that the complications and obstacles that have impeded our first group project, I have had to focus most of my attention there, and am out of time to pursue this assignment further. Ultimately, while I am not happy with the status of this assignment, I understand the concepts it covers, and they are all implemented in greater depth in our group project.

## Known issues
1. Buttons for past searches are created, but do not actively call results of their own.
2. Icons are not working in the weather, or 5 day forecast results.
3. Styling needs tweaking all around
4. Could optimize code by rewriting as a for loop if I had time, but prioritizing group project at this stage.
5. Not saving to local storage
